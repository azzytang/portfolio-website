      <p>
        Hi, I am a junior in highschool attending the Texas Academy of Math and
        Science (TAMS) on the Computer Science track.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been coding for 3 years and enjoy participating in coding
        competitions and hackathons. Creating websites, games, etc. are also
        passions of mine, as it allows me to apply my knowledge to something
        real that people can experience and interact with. You can see the
        projects I have finished or are working on here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coding language I am most comforatble with is Python, as it is my
        first language. I also know Java, Javascript, C++, CSS, HTML, and Swift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from computer science, I also love to weightlift, cook, and play
        sports.
